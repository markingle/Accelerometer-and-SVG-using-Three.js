
This project is my very first working example that I created pulling from different sources:

This jiddle example was very helpful:

Also its worth mention the Threejs.org site which has some amazing anitmation!!!

I used this websocket library:

The hardware is an Edison dev board and Grove sensor kit.  Hopefully I have added enough comments in the code to explain things but feel free to post an issue to ask questions.

And if someone reviews this project with experience in SVG, Three.js, Websockets, etc please feel free to make recommendations to help me learn more!!!!
